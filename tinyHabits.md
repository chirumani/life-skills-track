# Tiny Habits

# 1.Your takeaways from the video

My 5 takeaways from the video are:

- Tiny habits are the key to lasting change. When we try to make big changes all at once, we're more likely to fail. But if we start with tiny habits, we're more likely to succeed and build momentum.

- The key to a tiny habit is that it's easy to do. If it's too hard, we're less likely to do it. So start with something that takes just a few seconds or minutes.

- Every habit has three parts: a cue, a behavior, and a reward. The cue is what triggers the behavior. The behavior is the action we take. And the reward is what makes us want to do the behavior again.

- To make a tiny habit stick, we need to make the cue obvious, the behavior attractive, and the reward satisfying. This means making sure we know when we're going to do the habit, making the habit itself enjoyable, and giving ourselves a reward for doing it.

- We need to celebrate our tiny habits, no matter how small they seem. This helps us stay motivated and on track.

# 3. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?

The B = MAP formula can be used to make making new habits easier by:

- Increasing motivation:- This can be done by setting clear goals, finding an accountability partner, or making the habit more enjoyable.
  
- Decreasing ability barriers:- This can be done by breaking the habit down into smaller steps, making the habit more accessible, or finding a way to make it easier to do.
  
- Creating prompts:- This can be done by setting reminders, putting post-it notes in strategic places, or associating the habit with something else that you already do.

- If you want to start exercising more, you could set a goal of walking for 10 minutes every day. This is a small and achievable goal that is easy to fit into your schedule. You could also find an accountability partner to help you stay motivated.

- If you want to start eating healthier, you could start by making small changes to your diet, such as drinking water instead of soda or eating fruits and vegetables for snacks. You could also make it easier to eat healthy by keeping healthy foods on hand and avoiding unhealthy foods in your home.

- If you want to start meditating, you could start by meditating for just 5 minutes a day. This is a very small commitment that you can easily make. You could also create a calming environment for your meditation practice and find a meditation technique that you enjoy.


# 4.Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

Celebrating after each successful completion of habit is important because it:

- Increases motivation:- When we celebrate our successes, it releases dopamine, a neurotransmitter that makes us feel good. This positive reinforcement helps us stay motivated and on track with our goals.
  
- Makes the habit more enjoyable:- When we associate a habit with positive feelings, we're more likely to want to do it again. Celebrating our successes helps us to create positive associations with our habits.

- Helps us stay on track:- When we celebrate our successes, it helps us to focus on the positive aspects of our progress. This can be helpful when we're feeling discouraged or tempted to give up.

- Increases our self-confidence:- When we celebrate our successes, it helps us to build our self-confidence. This can lead to a more positive outlook on life and a greater sense of accomplishment.


# 5.Your takeaways from the video 

Here are 5 takeaways from the video "1% Better Every Day" by James Clear:

- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement:- Small, consistent changes can lead to big results over time.

- It's not about being perfect, it's about being better:- Don't worry about making every habit perfect. Just focus on making small improvements each day.

- Make it obvious:- Make it easy to do the habit by putting it in a visible place and removing any obstacles.

- Make it attractive:- Make the habit enjoyable by associating it with something you like or by making it challenging.

- Make it satisfying:- Reward yourself for doing the habit, even if it's just a small reward.


# 6.Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes and outcomes?

The book Atomic Habits by James Clear discusses about three different perspectives on habit formation: identity, processes, and outcomes.

- Identity is the deepest level of change:- It's about who you see yourself as. When you change your identity, your habits will naturally follow. For example, if you see yourself as a healthy person, you'll be more likely to eat healthy foods and exercise regularly.

- Processes are the second level of change:- They're about the systems and routines you put in place to support your desired identity. For example, if you want to be a more productive person, you might create a daily to-do list and set aside specific times each day for work and for leisure.

- Outcomes are the most superficial level of change:- They're about the results you want to achieve. For example, you might want to lose weight, get a promotion, or learn a new skill.

- Clear argues that the most effective way to change your habits is to focus on identity first, then processes, and then outcomes. This is because when you change your identity, it becomes easier to follow the processes that will support your new identity. And when you follow the processes, you're more likely to achieve the outcomes you want.


# 7.Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier

The book Atomic Habits by James Clear offers a number of strategies for making good habits easier. Here are a few of the key takeaways:

- Make it obvious:- The easier it is to do a habit, the more likely you are to do it. So make sure your habit is something that you can do easily and without much thought. 
- For example, if you want to start meditating, you could set up a meditation space in your bedroom and make sure you have all of your supplies ready to go.

- Make it attractive:- If you can make your habit something that you enjoy, you're more likely to stick with it. For example, if you want to start exercising, you could find a workout buddy or join a fitness class. This will make exercising more fun and social, which will make it more likely that you'll stick with it.

- Make it satisfying:- When you do your habit, make sure you give yourself a reward. This could be anything from a small treat to a pat on the back. Rewarding yourself will help to make your habit more enjoyable and more likely that you'll do it again in the future.


# 8.Write about the book's perspective on making a bad habit more difficult?

The book Atomic Habits by James Clear offers a number of strategies for making bad habits more difficult. Here are a few of the key takeaways:

- Make it invisible:- The less visible a bad habit is, the less likely you are to do it. So try to hide the triggers for your bad habit. 
  
- For example, if you want to stop snacking on unhealthy foods, you could put them out of sight in the pantry or the fridge.
  
- Make it unattractive:- If you can make your bad habit something that you don't enjoy, you're less likely to do it. 
  
- For example, if you want to stop biting your nails, you could wear gloves or put a bitter tasting nail polish on your nails.
  
- Make it unsatisfying:- When you do your bad habit, make sure you don't reward yourself. This will help to break the association between your bad habit and a reward. 
  
- For example, if you want to stop smoking, don't give yourself a cigarette break after you finish a difficult task.


# 9.Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

One habit that I would like to do more of is writing. I enjoy writing, but I often find it difficult to make time for it. Here are some steps that I can take to make it more obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying:

- Make the cue obvious:- I can make the cue for writing more obvious by setting aside a specific time each day for writing. 
  
- For example, I could commit to writing for 30 minutes every morning after I wake up. This will help me to make writing a part of my daily routine and make it less likely that I forget about it.
  
- Make the habit more attractive:- I can make the habit of writing more attractive by finding a topic that I'm passionate about. 
  
- For example, I could write about my hobbies, my travel experiences, or my thoughts on current events. I could also join a writing group or workshop to connect with other writers and get feedback on my work.
  
- Make it easy: I can make the habit of writing easier by setting small goals for myself. For example, I could start by writing for just 10 minutes each day. I could also break down my writing into smaller tasks, such as brainstorming ideas, outlining my thoughts, or editing my work.
  
- Make the response satisfying:- I can make the response to writing more satisfying by rewarding myself for completing my writing goals. 
  
- For example, I could give myself a break to read, watch a movie, or go for a walk after I finish writing. I could also share my writing with others and get feedback on my work.


# 10.Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

One habit that I would like to eliminate or do less of is checking my phone too often. I find myself constantly checking my phone for notifications, even when I'm not expecting any. This can be a major distraction and can make it difficult to focus on other tasks. Here are some steps that I can take to make it less likely that I check my phone too often:

- Make the cue invisible:- I can make the cue for checking my phone less visible by putting my phone away when I'm not using it. 
- For example, I could put my phone in a different room or in a drawer. This will help me to break the habit of checking my phone out of habit.
  
- Make the process unattractive:- I can make the process of checking my phone less attractive by turning off all notifications except for the most important ones. This will help me to avoid being tempted to check my phone every time I get a notification. I could also try using a productivity app that blocks distracting websites and apps.
  
- Make it hard:- I can make it harder for me to check my phone by setting a timer for 20 minutes and only checking my phone once the timer goes off. This will help me to focus on other tasks for longer periods of time without being interrupted. I could also try leaving my phone in another room when I'm working on something important.
  
- Make the response unsatisfying:- I can make the response to checking my phone less satisfying by not allowing myself to look at social media or other distracting websites. I could also try setting a rule for myself that I can only check my phone for a certain amount of time each day.
