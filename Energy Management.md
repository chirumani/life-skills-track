# 5.What are some ideas that you can implement to sleep better?

Here are some ideas that you can implement to sleep better:
- Stick to a regular sleep schedule:- Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends. This will help to regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.
- Create a relaxing bedtime routine:- This could include taking a warm bath, reading a book, or listening to calming music. Avoid watching TV or using electronic devices in the hour before bed, as the blue light emitted from these devices can interfere with sleep.
- Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool:- Darkness helps to promote the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps to regulate sleep. Noise and light can disrupt sleep, so make sure your bedroom is as dark and quiet as possible. A cool temperature is also ideal for sleep.
- Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed:- Caffeine and alcohol can both interfere with sleep. Caffeine can make it difficult to fall asleep, while alcohol can disrupt sleep later in the night.
- Get regular exercise:- Exercise can help to improve sleep quality, but avoid exercising too close to bedtime, as this can make it difficult to fall asleep.
- See a doctor if you have chronic sleep problems:- If you have chronic sleep problems, see a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions. There are also many sleep medications available, but they should only be used under the guidance of a doctor.

# 6.Paraphrase the video - Brain Changing Benefits of Exercise. Minimum 5 points

The brain changing benefits of exercise are:-
- Exercise increases the size of the hippocampus, the brain region responsible for learning and memory. This is why exercise is often recommended for people with Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive disorders.
- Exercise increases the production of new brain cells, a process called neurogenesis. This is especially important in the hippocampus, which is one of the few areas of the brain where neurogenesis can occur in adults.
- Exercise improves blood flow to the brain. This helps to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the brain cells, which is essential for their health and function.
- Exercise increases the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that promotes the growth and survival of brain cells. BDNF is also important for learning and memory.
- Exercise reduces stress and anxiety. This is because exercise releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects. Endorphins are also known as "feel-good" chemicals.

# 7.What are some steps you can take to exercise more?

The steps you can take to exercise more are:-
- Set realistic goals:- Don't try to do too much too soon, or you'll be more likely to give up. Start with a goal of 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week, and gradually increase the amount of time you exercise as you get fitter.
- Find an activity you enjoy:- If you don't enjoy your exercise, you're less likely to stick with it. There are many different types of exercise, so find one that you find fun and that you can see yourself doing on a regular basis.
- Make exercise a part of your routine:- Schedule time for exercise in your day, just like you would any other important appointment. This will help you to make it a priority and to stick with it.
- Find a workout buddy:- Exercising with a friend or family member can help you to stay motivated and accountable.
Reward yourself. When you reach a fitness goal, reward yourself with something you enjoy. This will help you to stay motivated and to keep exercising.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help:- If you're struggling to stick with an exercise routine, talk to your doctor or a certified personal trainer. They can help you to create an exercise plan that is right for you and that you can stick with.
