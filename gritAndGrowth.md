- In the video, Duckworth shares her own story of how she came to study grit. She was working as a management consultant when she decided to leave her job and become a teacher.

Some of her students who were not as academically gifted as others were able to achieve great things because they had grit.

- Grit is more important than IQ for success in many domains, including academics, sports, and the military.
  
- Grit can be learned and developed through practice.

     - (1) a strong sense of purpose

# 5.What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?
