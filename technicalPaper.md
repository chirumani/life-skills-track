# Firewall

Firewalls are network security devices that are designed to  control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on some predefined security rules. They act as a barrier between internal networks such as our computers,laptops and external networks such as the internet by preventing unauthorized access and protecting our system from malicious data which has virus.It will protect our local networks from hackers who stole our personal information like bank details.

It is a software program or a piece of hardware that restricts the entering of virus,worms to out local networks.Software program is a program that is installed in our pc whereas hardware firewall is device placed between our local networks and internet.A firewall decides which network traffic is allowed to pass through and which traffic is dangerous to our local networks.It filters the good data from the unwanted data.

# Types of Firewalls:

# Packet-Filtering Firewalls: 
A packet filtering firewall is a type of firewall that operates at the network level to filter and control network traffic based on predefined rules. It examines individual packets of data as they pass through the firewall and makes decisions on whether to allow or block them based on specific criteria, such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol types.

packet filtering firewalls are commonly used as a first line of defense in network security architectures. They provide an essential layer of protection by filtering and controlling network traffic based on basic criteria. However, for comprehensive security, organizations often supplement packet filtering firewalls with additional security measures, such as intrusion detection systems, application-level firewalls, or next-generation firewalls.
# Proxy Firewalls: 
A proxy firewall is also known as an application-level gateway firewall, is a type of firewall that operates at the application layer of the network stack. It acts as an intermediary between clients and servers, inspecting and filtering network traffic at a deep level, providing advanced security features and application-specific control.

Firewalls that operate at the application layer which analyze application specific protocols and provid enhanced security to our local networks from malicious data.
Proxy firewalls are commonly deployed in environments where granular control and advanced security features are required. They are often used in enterprise networks, educational institutions, and organizations with high-security requirements, as they provide strong protection against application-level attacks and allow for fine-grained access control and monitoring.
# Hybrid Firewall
A hybrid firewall refers to a combination or integration of different firewall technologies or functionalities to provide comprehensive network security. It combines the strengths of multiple firewall types to address specific security requirements and offer a layered defense approach.

The goal of a hybrid firewall is to leverage the strengths of different firewall technologies and create a comprehensive security architecture that provides defense in depth. By integrating multiple firewall functionalities, organizations can address different security requirements, enhance threat detection capabilities, and achieve a more robust and adaptive network security posture.
